#   Drum Kit

This Drum Kit Project is an interactive web application built using JavaScript that enables users to play sounds either by clicking on elements on the webpage or pressing specific keys on their keyboard. The project demonstrates the use of event listeners to detect user interactions and triggers corresponding sound effects dynamically.


## Features

1. Interactive UI: 
Each drum button is visually represented on the webpage.
Clicking on a drum triggers the associated sound.

2. Keyboard Support:
The drum kit is fully functional with keyboard inputs. Pressing assigned keys (e.g., 'w', 'a', 's', etc.) plays the respective drum sound.

3. Sound Effects:
Different sounds are mapped to various buttons (e.g., toms, snare, kick bass, and crash).

4. Animation Effects:
A visual animation highlights the button press for both mouse clicks and key presses, providing instant feedback to the user.
